# ACTUAL Teeny Icons 

I was a little disappointed when I saw that teenyicons, which claims to be 1px icons, was actually 15px icons. To remedy the situation I decided to make a collection of icons that are actually 1px icons. The site shows them at 5x scale to be somewhat usable but when they are copied to the clipboard they are actually 1px x 1px.

## Note

This is obviously a joke. Clearly 1px icons are completely useless.
